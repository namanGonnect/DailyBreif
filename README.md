#Daily Breif:
The soul purpose of this program is to provide three sources of 
confusion in school a way to become resolved. As such, it aims to rectify:

     -> The inability to find timatables.
     -> Students not being able to recieve motivation whilst in class.
     -> Requirements to store spontaneous tasks and make sure they get done.
   
###Timetables:
A timetable is something that all students receive in most schools 
and ensures that they reach the correct class in the correct room.
However, these simple objects become lost so frequently that in reality the 
concern always becomes 'Who should I ask for where the go?'. 
The more harsh truth is that, psychologically the act of constantly
thinking and worrying deviates students from actual learning. 
Simply, this can be addressed by feature component one of the DailyBreif. 
Which refers to a timetable printed at runtime.

 - Updates after each refresh (V2)
 - Shows room of class
 - Shows subject of period
 - Hours left in day
 
###Motivational Aspect:
In conjunction to the easing loss of tension coming from an always available 
timetable, a motivational message is displayed to uplift student mood 
and higher the chances of confident & as strong learning. 
 
_This includes but is not limited to:_
  - Simple directives that ground student.
  - Complex quotes that get the brain thinking.
  - Plain comments of pure uplift. 
  
###Spontaneous Task Management:
To illustrate, 'It's a Friday afternoon, late at school. You are a History lesson, 
heading to English. In between the change, in the last 5 mins the History teacher reminds you 
to do something small, being Friday did you even bother to remember... Probably not.
Therefore, bring the program in to picture, you were checking the timetable anyways,
so you added the new task to the task list built in.'

_This is effective because:_
1. The program removes friction -> against doing a task
2. It ensures that small things don't add up to = big losses
3. Always knowing what to do, means you know when + how to do it. ('Why' -> Simply to clear the TODO)
